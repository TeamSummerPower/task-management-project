Back-end:
	Entity:
		Priority = {not important, important, very important, mandatory};
		Task = {title, description, deadline, priority}
		/* User = {first name, last name, tasks list, username, password} */;

	Functionality:
		/* log in/sign up/log out* /
		add new task;
		edit task:
			title, description, deadline, priority (not mandatory);
		delete task;
		load tasks;
		sort tasks:
			by time, by priority;
			

Frond-end:
	/* it depends on time and capabilities */
	
Database:
	Probably MySQL:
		table task - title, description, deadline, priority, user_id;
		table user - first name, last name,, username, password;
